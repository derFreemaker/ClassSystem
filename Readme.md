# Lua Class System

Class System in pure lua.

Made in lua 5.4 maybe works with lower versions.

The [Samples](https://github.com/derFreemaker/ClassSystem/tree/master/samples) also act as Documentation.

`ClassSystem.lua` is the only file you need. It contains all files combined from the src folder.
It is not performance optimized at the moment.

The tests are awfully writen but work.

## Features

-   Class Extension
