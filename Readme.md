# Lua Class System

Class System in pure lua.

Build in lua 5.4 maybe works with lower versions.

**Please** read the [Samples](https://github.com/derFreemaker/ClassSystem/tree/master/samples) they also act as Documentation.

`ClassSystem.lua` is the only file it contains all files combined from the src folder.
It is not performance optimized at the moment.
